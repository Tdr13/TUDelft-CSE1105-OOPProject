# Code Contributions and Code Reviews

#### Focused Commits

Grade: Very Good

Feedback: Top: - The repository has a good amount of commits for now.
	- Commits aggregate a coherent change to the system.
Tip: - Please try to follow the sentence "This commit will" + the commit message for your commit messages. 

#### Isolation

Grade: Very Good

Feedback: Top: - Overall, it appears that the team is following a good development process.
 - I like that you used feature branches/MR to isolate individual features.


#### Reviewability

Grade: Very Good

Feedback: Top: - The MRs consistently have a clear focus that can be easily determined from the title and description, making them easy to understand and review.
	- I liked that for most of the MR you gave a clear description of the changes made by that MR. 
	- The MRs contain a low number of formatting changes, reducing noise and making it easier to focus on substantive changes.
	- I also like that the MRs usually only cover a small number of commits, which makes it easier to understand and review the changes.
Tip: - You can close issues directly from the MR by writing "Closes #" and the number of the issue.

#### Code Reviews

Grade: Very Good

Feedback: Top: - Overall, the team is using the MRs effectively to review each other's code contributions and provide feedback.
	- Comments in the MRs are constructive and goal-oriented, which demonstrates that the team is focused on the end goal of merging changes and improving the codebase.
	- The reviews actually lead to improvements of the code.
	- Great job with comments and reviews! MRs actually receive a discussion. I really like this!
Tip: - There's no such thing as too many when it comes to providing feedback and collaborating to improve the codebase. Keep up the good work!

#### Build Server

Grade: Good

Feedback: Top: - I have seen that you choose the check style rules.
	- Great to see that the builds are not failing too frequently, especially on the main branch.
Tip: -  Please make sure that your pipeline doesn't fail before making the merge request.
