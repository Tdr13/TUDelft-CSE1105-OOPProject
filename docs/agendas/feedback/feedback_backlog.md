### Backlog

### Submission

Mark: Pass

Feedback: The backlog draft was delivered on time.

### Backlog Structure

Mark: Pass

Feedback: Your backlog contains stakeholders, terminology, a list of user stories and mocks.

### Epics

Mark: Insufficient

Feedback: The prioritization of stories is good and it is consistent with lecture. Unfortunately there was a misunderstanding regarding Moscow method and epics and you should group your features using Epics not Moscow method.
This should not that you long because the prioritization of stories is good. Please use the slides as a reference of how to group them into epics and the example from last year for the user stories.

### User Stories

Mark: Good

Feedback: The user stories follow the required format. I also liked that your requirements were written from the user perspective. The size of the user stories should be small and each user story should contain only one feature. Your first user story contains
five user stories. You should divide this one into five user stories. Make sure you apply this everywhere in your backlog. Also don't forget to add why you need that requirement everywhere. I liked that you divided the users into team members and admin.


### Acceptance Criteria

Mark: Insufficient

Feedback: For each user story you should add acceptance criteria (see slides). This is mandatory and you must add this to your backlog.
